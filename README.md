# 1337 / 42 Pool (Piscine)

## What is the Pool?

The **Piscine** is a **4-week intensive bootcamp** used by **1337 (42 Network)** to select students.
It is not a training program. It is a **filter**.

You are thrown into C programming and basic computer science with **no teachers**, **no lectures**, and **almost no guidance**. If you can survive, you pass. If not, you’re out.

Expect:

* Long hours
* Constant pressure
* Frequent failure
* Harsh grading
* No hand-holding

That is intentional.

## Core Philosophy

1337/42 is built on 3 ideas:

1. **Self-learning**
   You are expected to search, read manuals, debug, and figure things out alone.

2. **Peer-to-peer evaluation**
   Students correct each other. If you don’t understand your own code, you fail.

3. **Discipline over talent**
   Smart but lazy students fail. Average but consistent students pass.

## What You Learn

### 1. Shell & Unix Basics

* Bash / Zsh
* File system navigation
* Permissions
* Pipes and redirections
* Basic scripting

### 2. C Programming (Main Focus)

You start from **zero** and go fast.

Topics include:

* Compilation (`gcc`)
* Makefiles (later)
* Variables & types
* Pointers (yes, early)
* Memory allocation (`malloc`, `free`)
* Strings and arrays
* Functions
* Header files
* Static libraries
* Error handling
* Norminette (strict coding style)

If pointers scare you, the Piscine will either fix that or break you.

---

## Projects Structure

### Daily Exercises (C00 → C13)

* Small focused tasks
* Meant to build fundamentals
* Autocorrected
* No partial credit

### Rushes

* Team projects
* Time-limited
* Stressful
* Reveal who actually understands and who just copies

### Exams

* Every week
* Individual
* Timed
* No internet
* No help
* Fail one badly → you’re in danger

---

## Norminette

Your code **must** follow the 42 coding norm.

Key rules:

* Max 25 lines per function
* Max 5 functions per file
* No `for`, only `while`
* No global variables
* One instruction per line
* Clean indentation
* Strict file structure

If your code works but violates the norm → **it fails**.

---

## Evaluation System

* Automated grading
* Peer correction
* Moulinette checks
* Final score is a mix of:

  * Exercises
  * Rushes
  * Exams
  * Consistency

You don’t need 100.
You **do** need to be reliable.

---

## What the Piscine Tests (Honestly)

Not intelligence.

It tests:

* Can you read documentation?
* Can you debug without panicking?
* Can you manage time and fatigue?
* Can you explain your code?
* Can you accept criticism?
* Can you keep going after failing?

Many people quit. That’s normal.

---

## Common Reasons People Fail

Be honest with yourself:

* Copy-pasting without understanding
* Ignoring the norm
* Skipping exercises
* Poor time management
* Ego (“I already know this”)
* Giving up after exams

Talent does not save you here.

---

## How to Survive

* Sleep enough (burnout kills faster than difficulty)
* Understand before moving on
* Ask *good* questions
* Read `man`, not tutorials only
* Write clean, simple code
* Re-read your own code before submission

---

## Final Reality Check

The Piscine is **not fair**, **not gentle**, and **not designed to help you succeed**.

It is designed to answer one question:

> *Can you survive autonomous learning under pressure?*

If yes → welcome to 1337.
If no → at least you learned something real.
